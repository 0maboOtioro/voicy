👋 Hello there! *Voicy* is a voice recognition bot that converts all voice messages and audio files (.ogg, .flac, .wav, .mp3) it gets into text.\n\n*Voicy* supports three voice recognition engines: wit.ai, Yandex SpeechKit and Google Speech. Initially it\'s set to use wit.ai but you can switch to Google Speech or Yandex SpeechKit anytime in /engine. More information in /help.

👋 Please, select the engine of speech recognition. Google Speech is more accurate and supports audio longer than 50 seconds, but has to be set up with your Google Cloud credentials (a bit tedious). Yandex SpeechKit is pretty accurate, free, private and most of the time supports audio longer than 50 seconds, but has limited list of languages. Wit.ai is less accurate, free, and doesn\'t support audio longer than 50 seconds, but has plenty of languages. Please, note that all three support different languages, so pick the one that suits you the best.

Only the person who started command can select options
